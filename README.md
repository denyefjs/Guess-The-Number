# 🎯 Guess The Number (Java Console Game)

A simple console-based Java game where the player tries to guess a number generated by the computer.
The project was created as part of **Fachabitur IT** practice to improve logic, input validation, and code structure.

## 🧠 What I learned

* Using `Scanner` correctly (`nextInt()`, `next()`, `hasNextInt()`)
* Handling invalid user input safely
* Generating random numbers using `Random`
